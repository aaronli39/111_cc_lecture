* two ways continents grow
    * igneous rocks(magma formed)
    * accretion(scraped off ocean crust)
* Earth has **14 tectonic plates**

#### climate

**ice ages**
* every 100,000 years or so, earth undergoes an ice age
* this is because earths orbit becomes very elliptical, so much of the year is cold
* ice is always moving downhill even when melting or freezing back
* origins
    * ice ages can happen accidentally
* **precession**: change axis of orbit
* **obliquition**: change in tilt of rotatino

**types of pollutino**
* combustion: pollutant as a directr discharge of industry and cars(carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide)
* photochemical sunlight needed(ozone)

* air pollution can be local, regional, or global
* Earth's CO2 was balanced until recent human influence
* **inversion layer**
    * cold air from mountains and oceans is more dense than warm air, so cold air becomes trapped. this is bad because if theres air pollution the air is trapped like a lid
* **all greenhouse gases are increasing**
    * water is a greenhouse gas. **cold water** holds more ice
* **keeling curve** is the curve/line of increasing CO2

* where did Earth's water come from? Only about 10% came from comets, and most of it probably came from carbonaceous chondrictic impacts like the one that formed the moon
* Earth is the only planet in our solar system that has subduction plate tectonics: one where a plate slides beneath another plate and melts and then goes into the mantle, which later rises as mantle diapirs

**Plate tectonics**
* Wegener proposed the idea of Pangea, but it was laughed upon
* convection currents are what form diverging and subduction effects
* average rate of seafloor spreading: 6cm/year
* the north and south floors flip
* subduction is constantly destroying ocean crust, which is why the ocean crust isnt that old

**wilson cycle**
* rifting subduction collision
* appalachian
* serpentine
* only forms from collsions
* when indea crashed w asian plate, it formed the himalayas

* rifts create new ocean crust
* seismic waves used to track the internals of the earth
* richter scale is a log scale

**early earth**
* early homogenous mix of iron, oxygen, silicon, and magnesium
* the radioactive elements: uranium, thorium, potassium
* volatiles lower the melting temperature
* iron and nickel sank, form the **core**
    * the "iron catastrophe
    * result: 3 main layers: crust, core, mantle
* the oldest rocks on earth are always on land and never under water
* we only find rocks up to 4.0 billion years because earth's tectonic plates and lava flow destroyed the older rocks

**determining the ages of rocks: geochronology**

**radioactive decay**
* we cant predict when any particular atom will decay, but there is a constant rate of decay of a population of parent atoms, governed by probability(the decay constant of a particular radioactive isotope)
* equation for radioactive decay: `dN/dt = -(lamba)N`
* radioactive decay is a natural clock because it is constant and is not affected by environment, just over time
* two different isotopes can have very different half-lives
* concordia's curve is what's used to determine age 
* **chondrites** are silicone and oxygen based meteorites
* a comet is the opposite of a meteorite: CO2 and H2O(ice)
* water came from volcanoes, melted CO2/H20

#### exoplanets
* planets and star attract each other

**doppler technique**
* measuring a stars doppler shift can tell us its motion towards and away from us
* current techniques can measure motions as small as 1 m/s
* delta lamba / lamba = velocity / c
* **redshift:** moving away frmo us, **blueshift:** moving towards us

**nebular theory after hot jupiters**
* planets did not necessarily form where they are
* planets likely *migrate* around the solar system after formation
* migration mechanisms are not fully understood

**extrasolar planets**
* exoplanet: a planet that *does not* orbit the Sun
* only recently discovered(early 1990s)
* today we know thousands of exoplanets, the vast majority of which orbit other stars, but some are *free-floating*
* the same criteria that we use to determine whether or not a planet is a planet in our solar system is used to determine the eiligibility of other exoplanets

**exoplanets are very hard to detect directly**
* a sun like star is about a billion times brighter than the light reflected from it's planets
* this is like trying to see a firefly next to a searchlight

**techniques for indirect detection**
bolded items below are the most popular methods of detection
* pulsation timing
* **the doppler technique**
* **the transit technique**
* direct dectection

**transit + doppler**
* transit tells you the orientation of the planet's orbital plane
* mass + radius -> density of the planet
* start to make statements about composition
* the orbital plane has to be in the line of sight or else u wont see the dimming of the planets and star light

**calculating density**
* using mass, determined using the doppler technique, and size, determined using the transit technique, density can be calculated
* **hot jupiters** are closer to the sun and similar in size to our jupiter
* **cold jupiters** are farther frmo the sun and similar in size to jupiter

#### dating the earth(geochronology)
* melting of the mantle is what spews up carbon dioxide and air and h20
* earths core is solid due to pressure

**3 ways of star death**(depends on mass)
* black hole
* neutron star
* white dwarf

**high mass star death**
* nuclear fusion goes beyond C and O
* increased gravitational pressure from massive star leads to increased temperatures in core, and fusion can create elements such as Si, S, Ca, and Fe
* all reactions up to Fe are exothermic, they release energy.
* in order to create error
* stars have a series of shells
* steps in producing a supernova
* one the core is Fe, it will contract and heat. the contraction is rapid
* after 0.25s of contraction, there core has R < 30m
* the shock reaches the star's surface after a few hours
  
**Different types of supernovae**
* a white dwarf in a binary system with a red giant can have a mass transferred onto it
* if the mass is then greater than the Chandrasekhar limit(1.4 times the size of the sun), the pressure will rise, C fusion will occur, T will rise, and the white dwarf explodes

**other differences**
* core collapse supernovae are found near sites of star formation(spiral arms)
* SN 1a(white dwar SNe) are found in galaxies with little or no star formation(older stars)
* core collapse supernovae leave behind core
* SN 1a leave behind no core
* there are differences in the light curves, because the different elemental abundances and their radioactive decays create light curve shapes.
* **SN 1a** can be used as standard candles and they can be seen to great distances, used for Dark Energy discovery!
* the peak brightness is ~same for all SN 1a, qualified by the decay rate
* we expect the same brightness because all SN 1a progenitors have the same mass(just off 1.4 times the mass of the sun)

**planet formation**
* planets form along with stars from collapsing clouds
* **nebular theory**: planets form in a co-rotation disk

####  the origin of the planets, earth, and its moon

* the fuel of our planets is not hydrogen, it's radioactivity
* stars form bc centripetal force keeps heavy elements in the center as dust and gas keep spinning and thats how eventually it is formed
* we are a silicon and oxygen based planet
* iron became our mantle because it's compressible and it gets melted 
* old submarines could be tracked because of their magnetic field
* carbon dioxide, water, and sulfer lower the melting temperature
* there's more gas in magma than there is lava liquid
* our air come from volcanoes originally
* volcanoes spew out air, oceans and life take it in, becomes stone, like the very CAS building 
* as meteorites fall to earth, pieces of tectites fly off 
* pluto has a lot of ice plains and mountains
* pluto is "alive": **no crators means alive**
* lunar marr is leftover dried salt magma that the moon bled billions of years ago
* there are several types of meteorites:
    * some are metals, others are stony

#### star formation and evolution
* how stars end their life depends on their mass
    * bigger ones die more violently
* plants form with stars
* orions sword appears fuzzy and is actually a nebula formed from 4 hot, massive stars**dark nebulas form stars**
* in the milky way, gas and dust are concentrated in the plane
* **dark nebulas form stars**
* spiral arms are sites of star formation because of the concentrations of gas and dust there
* dust is concentrated in the galaxy's midplane

**protostars**
* protostars are future main sequence stars
* what are the criteria that will determine whether a cloud will collapse to form a star?
    * the gravitational potential of the cloud must overwhelm the kinetic energy
* the only parts of the ISM that are dense and cold enough to form stars are dark nebulae(areas that you can't see anything)
* luminosity: intrinsic brightness(output)
* main sequence stars have a mass of 0.08 ~ 200 times the mass of the sun
* on the low end,pressure and temperature will not get high enough for nuclear fusion(brown dwarfs)
* on the high end, radiation pressure limits the luminsoity a star can have (Eddington limit)

**clusters of stars**
* because of fragmentation, stars often form in clusters
* clusters have stars of the same age with a range of masses, good labs for comparing evolution of different mass stars

**star formation triggers**
* spiral arms
* supernovae
* collision between clouds

**after the main sequence**
* lifetime is around 12 Gyr
* the sun is about halfway through main sequence life
* zero-age main sequence star = star that has just arrived at main sequence
* stars evolve while on the MS
* they evolve in luminosity, temperature, and radius
* when sun is formed, its composition was about 74% hydrogen, 25% helium, 1% other
* number of atomic nuclei goes down over time in the star's core
    * the pressure goes down(fewer collisions)
    * the core slightly contracts, which leads to increased density and temperature and pressure
* hydrogen nuclei then collide more frequently and the rate of hydrogen fusion goes up, leading to luminosity and radius increase
* in 1.5 Gyr, temperature of the earth will be ~122 degrees fahrenheit

**cosmic microwave background**
* evidence of a hot big bang
* observations show that there is more He in the universe than could have been produced in stars. this means that we think there was fusion going on even before stars happened(early days of the universe)
* just after the big bang, the universe would have been so hot that thermonuclear reactions could have taken place.
* we dont really know what triggered the big bang
* black body radiation: anything that has non 0 temperature emits some form of light(infrared, etc)
* universe has expanded so much that the wavelength of light has just been stretched so much and this left
* over radiation is what cosmic microwave background is 
* with T~10^7K, hydrogen will fuse into He
* the emission would have blackbody spectrum that woudl have filled the early universe
* the universe has expanded greatly since then, and the light associated with the high T has been redshifted to lower E, longer wavelength emission
* the expected observable T is now a few K
* expect peak emission at microwave wavelengths ~1mm("cosmic microwave background)
* energy is the missing mass from fusion reactions in early days of the iuniverse
* cosmic microwave background was described in Bell Labs, NJ when they discovered faint background noise all over the sky. (Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, nobel peace prize 1978)
* **COBE(1989)** 
    * measured a blackbody spectrum with T=2.725K!
    * the detection was **isotropic**(same in all direcitons with slight variations) these variations will turn out to be very important
* **evolution of radiation temp**
    * when the universe was 2,500 years old, the CMB had a wavelength of around ~40nm and T=68,000K and this declines
    * T=3000K and z~1000 was a time of "the Era of Recombination"
* recombination allows hydrogen atoms to become neutral again, the universe became transparent as a result of this. before recombination, the universe was opague bc hydrogen atoms couldnt escape and there was increased heat
* the most ancient photons we can see are the CMB from z=1100 (380,000 years after the big bang)
* **anisotropy**: not the same in all directions
* **splace is flat**
* bulk of the mass in the universe is of an unknown form we call "black matter
* constant expression: the more sisa

**the early univese**
* tge cabbit ibvserve the universe at a time before recombination
* still, we can deduce some properties of the the universe before that time

**heisenberg uncertainty principle**
* matter can appear and disappear 
* a particle appears with an anti-particle
* the more massive the particle, the shorter time it can exist

**primoridal nucelosynthesis**
* a few elements were formed in the early universe, while the other elements came later(nuclear fusion)
* the elements were He, Li, Be, and H

**star formation and evolution**
* we think that as star forms, planets form along with them
* stars form from collapsing clouds of gas and dust. the collapse is triggered by compression from i.e. a spiral arm or a supernova explosion
* as internal pressure rises, T rises, and H fusion can begin
* stars form from the interstellar medium(ISM)
* h2 regions" emission nebulae(ionized hyodrgen, h1 is hydrogen)
    * eg: orion nebula. appears red
* **nebula types:**
    * emission(orion)
    * reflection
    * dark(horsehead nebula)
        * stars actually only form in dark nebulae
* interstellar neddening is caused by dust grains observing and scattering blue light
