**cosmic microwave background**
* evidence of a hot big bang
* observations show that there is more He in the universe than could have been produced in stars. this means that we think there was fusion going on even before stars happened(early days of the universe)
* just after the big bang, the universe would have been so hot that thermonuclear reactions could have taken place.
* we dont really know what triggered the big bang
* black body radiation: anything that has non 0 temperature emits some form of light(infrared, etc)
* universe has expanded so much that the wavelength of light has just been stretched so much and this leftover radiation is what cosmic microwave background is 
* with T~10^7K, hydrogen will fuse into He
* the emission would have blackbody spectrum that woudl have filled the early universe
* the universe has expanded greatly since then, and the light associated with the high T has been redshifted to lower E, longer wavelength emission
* the expected observable T is now a few K
* expect peak emission at microwave wavelengths ~1mm("cosmic microwave background)
* energy is the missing mass from fusion reactions in early days of the iuniverse
* cosmic microwave background was described in Bell Labs, NJ when they discovered faint background noise all over the sky. (Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, nobel peace prize 1978)
* **COBE(1989)** 
    * measured a blackbody spectrum with T=2.725K!
    * the detection was **isotropic**(same in all direcitons with slight variations) these variations will turn out to be very important
* **evolution of radiation temp**
    * when the universe was 2,500 years old, the CMB had a wavelength of around ~40nm and T=68,000K and this declines
    * T=3000K and z~1000 was a time of "the Era of Recombination"
* recombination allows hydrogen atoms to become neutral again, the universe became transparent as a result of this. before recombination, the universe was opague bc hydrogen atoms couldnt escape and there was increased heat
* the most ancient photons we can see are the CMB from z=1100 (380,000 years after the big bang)
* **anisotropy**: not the same in all directions
* **splace is flat**
* bulk of the mass in the universe is of an unknown form we call "black matter
* constant expression: the more sisa

**the earky univese**
* tge cabbit ibvserve the universe at a time before recombination
* still, we can deduce some properties of the the universe before that time

**heisenberg uncertainty principle**
* matter can appear and disappear 
* a particle appears with an anti-particle
* the more massive the particle, the shorter time it can exist

**primoridal nucelosynthesis**
* a few elements were formed in the early universe, while the other elements came later(nuclear fusion)
* the elements were He, Li, Be, and H

**star formation and evolution**
* we think that as star forms, planets form along with them
* stars form from collapsing clouds of gas and dust. the collapse is triggered by compression from i.e. a spiral arm or a supernova explosion
* as internal pressure rises, T rises, and H fusion can begin
* stars form from the interstellar medium(ISM)
* h2 regions" emission nebulae(ionized hyodrgen, h1 is hydrogen)
    * eg: orion nebula. appears red
* **nebula types:**
    * emission(orion)
    * reflection
    * dark(horsehead nebula)
        * stars actually only form in dark nebulae
* interstellar neddening is caused by dust grains observing and scattering blue light
