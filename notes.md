####  the origin of the planets, earth, and its moon

* the fuel of our planets is not hydrogen, it's radioactivity
* stars form bc centripetal force keeps heavy elements in the center as dust and gas keep spinning and thats how eventually it is formed
* we are a silicon and oxygen based planet
* iron became our mantle because it's compressible and it gets melted 
* old submarines could be tracked because of their magnetic field
* carbon dioxide, water, and sulfer lower the melting temperature
* there's more gas in magma than there is lava liquid
* our air come from volcanoes originally
* volcanoes spew out air, oceans and life take it in, becomes stone, like the very CAS building 
* as meteorites fall to earth, pieces of tectites fly off 
* pluto has a lot of ice plains and mountains
* pluto is "alive": **no crators means alive**
* lunar marr is leftover dried salt magma that the moon bled billions of years ago
* there are several types of meteorites:
    * some are metals, others are stony

#### star formation and evolution
* how stars end their life depends on their mass
    * bigger ones die more violently
* plants form with stars
* orions sword appears fuzzy and is actually a nebula formed from 4 hot, massive stars**dark nebulas form stars**
* in the milky way, gas and dust are concentrated in the plane
* **dark nebulas form stars**
* spiral arms are sites of star formation because of the concentrations of gas and dust there
* dust is concentrated in the galaxy's midplane

**protostars**
* protostars are future main sequence stars
* what are the criteria that will determine whether a cloud will collapse to form a star?
    * the gravitational potential of the cloud must overwhelm the kinetic energy
* the only parts of the ISM that are dense and cold enough to form stars are dark nebulae(areas that you can't see anything)
* luminosity: intrinsic brightness(output)
* main sequence stars have a mass of 0.08 ~ 200 times the mass of the sun
* on the low end,pressure and temperature will not get high enough for nuclear fusion(brown dwarfs)
* on the high end, radiation pressure limits the luminsoity a star can have (Eddington limit)

**clusters of stars**
* because of fragmentation, stars often form in clusters
* clusters have stars of the same age with a range of masses, good labs for comparing evolution of different mass stars

**star formation triggers**
* spiral arms
* supernovae
* collision between clouds

**after the main sequence**
* lifetime is around 12 Gyr
* the sun is about halfway through main sequence life
* zero-age main sequence star = star that has just arrived at main sequence
* stars evolve while on the MS
* they evolve in luminosity, temperature, and radius
* when sun is formed, its composition was about 74% hydrogen, 25% helium, 1% other
* number of atomic nuclei goes down over time in the star's core
    * the pressure goes down(fewer collisions)
    * the core slightly contracts, which leads to increased density and temperature and pressure
* hydrogen nuclei then collide more frequently and the rate of hydrogen fusion goes up, leading to luminosity and radius increase
* in 1.5 Gyr, temperature of the earth will be ~122 degrees fahrenheit

**cosmic microwave background**
* evidence of a hot big bang
* observations show that there is more He in the universe than could have been produced in stars. this means that we think there was fusion going on even before stars happened(early days of the universe)
* just after the big bang, the universe would have been so hot that thermonuclear reactions could have taken place.
* we dont really know what triggered the big bang
* black body radiation: anything that has non 0 temperature emits some form of light(infrared, etc)
* universe has expanded so much that the wavelength of light has just been stretched so much and this left
* over radiation is what cosmic microwave background is 
* with T~10^7K, hydrogen will fuse into He
* the emission would have blackbody spectrum that woudl have filled the early universe
* the universe has expanded greatly since then, and the light associated with the high T has been redshifted to lower E, longer wavelength emission
* the expected observable T is now a few K
* expect peak emission at microwave wavelengths ~1mm("cosmic microwave background)
* energy is the missing mass from fusion reactions in early days of the iuniverse
* cosmic microwave background was described in Bell Labs, NJ when they discovered faint background noise all over the sky. (Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, nobel peace prize 1978)
* **COBE(1989)** 
    * measured a blackbody spectrum with T=2.725K!
    * the detection was **isotropic**(same in all direcitons with slight variations) these variations will turn out to be very important
* **evolution of radiation temp**
    * when the universe was 2,500 years old, the CMB had a wavelength of around ~40nm and T=68,000K and this declines
    * T=3000K and z~1000 was a time of "the Era of Recombination"
* recombination allows hydrogen atoms to become neutral again, the universe became transparent as a result of this. before recombination, the universe was opague bc hydrogen atoms couldnt escape and there was increased heat
* the most ancient photons we can see are the CMB from z=1100 (380,000 years after the big bang)
* **anisotropy**: not the same in all directions
* **splace is flat**
* bulk of the mass in the universe is of an unknown form we call "black matter
* constant expression: the more sisa

**the early univese**
* tge cabbit ibvserve the universe at a time before recombination
* still, we can deduce some properties of the the universe before that time

**heisenberg uncertainty principle**
* matter can appear and disappear 
* a particle appears with an anti-particle
* the more massive the particle, the shorter time it can exist

**primoridal nucelosynthesis**
* a few elements were formed in the early universe, while the other elements came later(nuclear fusion)
* the elements were He, Li, Be, and H

**star formation and evolution**
* we think that as star forms, planets form along with them
* stars form from collapsing clouds of gas and dust. the collapse is triggered by compression from i.e. a spiral arm or a supernova explosion
* as internal pressure rises, T rises, and H fusion can begin
* stars form from the interstellar medium(ISM)
* h2 regions" emission nebulae(ionized hyodrgen, h1 is hydrogen)
    * eg: orion nebula. appears red
* **nebula types:**
    * emission(orion)
    * reflection
    * dark(horsehead nebula)
        * stars actually only form in dark nebulae
* interstellar neddening is caused by dust grains observing and scattering blue light
